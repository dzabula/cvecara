PROMO CODE: Marko Dasic

I did the project myself as an exam requirement for the third, final, year of college.
This is a web application built in the Laravel framework. The application represents the flower web shop.

It is accessed by both logged in and non-logged in users.
Kroisnik can:
- search for products
- add the product to the basket
- view the list of products in the basket
- enter the promo code to get a discount
- create an order, after successfully creating an order, the user receives an email about the successful purchase.

The administrator can:
- search orders
- mark that an order has been sent or mark that the order has been delivered
- delete the order.
- create, modify, remove from the state, restore the state of the product
- view (filtering by date) application statistics (site visits, total earnings, number of application logins)

MySql database was used, code first approach.
It is server side rendering.
Authorization is performed using a session.
I manually modified the downloaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript code from the internet.
MVC architecture is used.
The blade template engine was used to display the front parts of the application.
The ORMs used are: mostly Eloquent and a little Query Builder.
All data that comes from the user to the server goes through ‚‚Request Validation‚‚
Middlewares were used for the purposes of customs roll authorization.

On this project I am:
- learned how to organize code according to MVC architecture.
- perfected the knowledge of the php language, especially object php.
- better understood the functioning of the session.
- learned how to create a database through code, code first approach.
- learned to use the composer (artisan) tool.
- learned to use ORM Eloquent and Query Builder.
- learned to use the blade template engine
